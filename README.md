## Webots Simulation - Maze Exploration and Optimization

The robot (Adept Pioneer 3-AT) maps the fixed maze and solves the optimal route with the Breadth-first Search (BFS) algorithm when it reaches a target tile.
The optimal route is visualized when the target tile is reached.

### Contents

- **/generate_maze** - code used for generating maze worlds in Webots
- **/my_controller** - the Pioneer 3-AT controller
- **/worlds** - the used world

### Known issues

- Only tested with the default maze so many edge-case scenarios will probably cause bugs.
